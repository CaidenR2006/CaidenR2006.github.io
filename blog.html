     <h4>Gaming with Emotions</h4>
		<p>Games can have a powerful impact on emotions. They can induce feelings of excitement, fear, happiness, and even aggression. For example, games that involve violence or competition can trigger aggressive emotions in some players. On the other hand, games that promote cooperation and teamwork can foster positive emotions and socialization.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Minecraft Game review</h4>
		<p>Minecraft, a global phenomenon since its introduction on PCs a few years back, continues to captivate players worldwide. The game's essence lies in crafting tools from gathered materials to construct structures like mansions through mining. Its Xbox version offers cooperative play and a unique crafting system. While exploring its mesmerizing landscapes, players must be cautious of hostile creatures like the infamous Creeper. Whether day or night, avoiding this creature is essential. The game's dynamic nature offers a plethora of achievements for players to unlock as they progress, such as crafting a furnace, opening their inventory for the first time, or even successfully catching a fish.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Dream PC Build</h4>
		<p>My dream rig is a desktop PC. I would buy the NZXT Player: Three AMD edition. It is perfect for me since I am into games and want to have the best performance I can get.</p>
		<h4>Toxicity in Gaming</h4>
		<p>Toxicity within gaming is when someone verbally assaults someone based on their skill within the game. The most common form of toxicity is swearing and overall being rude. It is important to understand what toxicity is in gaming so we can help prevent it and prevent the repercussions that can happen. We can combat toxicity by not feeding into the person who is being toxic.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Best Esports Teams</h4>
		<p>The best esports teams practice the events beforehand together on the specific maps to know where things are to get a better advantage and understanding of the map. They communicate very well with each other by calling out specific people that could be dangerous and understanding the competition. Things that can always improve is possible toxicity within the team.</p>
		<h4>Health Technology</h4>
		<p>The device is a watch and the program beeps whenever you sit down for too long and don't move.To remind you to get up and do an activity. I would suggest it to a gamer because it will remind them constantly to get up and move around to do an activity. Every hour or so with no activity your watch beeps and tells you to move around. Knowing gamers they do not move around all that often so this will help them exercise between games and whatnot. It is very easy to keep track of and keep up with, and not hard to learn at all</p>
		<h4>Creative Commons</h4>
		<p>Creative Commons is an American non-profit organization and international network devoted to educational access and expanding the range of creative works available for others to build upon legally and to share.</p>
		<h4>My Favorite Game</h4>
	  <p>My favorite game of all time is going to be Madden 13. It was one of the first games I had ever played on my Wii and I loved every bit of it from franchise to the mini challenges. Most of the reviews say it is overall a mid tier game due to the graphics and gameplay. Overall after sone years I would have to agree because the franchise is not that great, the graphics could have been way better for its time&nbsp;</p>
